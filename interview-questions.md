# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a console command and Github is website

Researched answer: git is a version control system that allows develpers to track changes in their code and Github is a web-based hosting service for git repositories.


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array can have multiple indexes depending on its length but only one value

Researched answer: The index is the location of a value while the value is the data stored at that location.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: a string is represented with "" while an array is represented with []. Both hold index values that start from 0.

Researched answer: Both have elements or characters that can be accessed in a sequence. Arrays can be mutated but strings cannot. Both have methods used specifically for them.

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher-order Functions: A built in method in JavaScript that takes in a function as an argument. Often higher-order functions are designed to operate on arrays. The function passed as an argument will execute once for every item in the array.

2. Jest: A JavaScript testing framework. The Jest framework is made up of a collection of files called dependencies which contain snippets of code functionality.

3. Objects: A JavaScript data type that has collections of key:value pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as actions in the form of methods. This makes objects the intersection of data and behavior.
